## Project Description

ClauseGuard is a web application that lets a user upload a contract (PDF, including scanned documents) and receive an automated risk analysis: which clauses are risky, why, how severe each risk is, and an overall risk score for the document. Results are shown on a dashboard and available as a downloadable PDF report.

## Problem Statement

Small businesses, freelancers, and individuals sign contracts constantly — vendor agreements, freelance contracts, NDAs, leases — but rarely have a lawyer review every one. Risky clauses (auto-renewal traps, unlimited liability, one-sided indemnification, unfavorable jurisdiction) get missed until they cause real financial or legal harm, and professional legal review is expensive and slow for routine documents.

## Why I Built This

This project was built as an AWS capstone with a hard requirement to use Amazon ECR and ECS meaningfully rather than as a checkbox. Contract analysis is a natural fit: the API layer and the document-processing workload have genuinely different resource and scaling profiles, which justifies running them as two independently deployable containerized services on the same ECS cluster — a realistic microservices pattern, not a single toy container.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate a production-style containerized microservices architecture on AWS Fargate.
- Build a real, useful tool rather than a CRUD demo.
- Show an asynchronous processing pipeline (SQS-decoupled producer/consumer).
- Stay within AWS Free Tier as much as reasonably possible.
- Produce fully automated, idempotent infrastructure provisioning.

## Features

- Email/password authentication with PBKDF2-hashed passwords and HMAC-signed session tokens (server-side revocable).
- Upload a contract PDF (including scanned/photographed documents via OCR).
- Asynchronous processing pipeline: upload → S3 → SQS → worker → Textract → risk engine → RDS.
- Transparent, explainable rule-based risk engine covering 10 common contract-risk categories (auto-renewal, unlimited liability, one-sided indemnification, unilateral termination, broad non-compete, perpetual confidentiality, assignment without consent, unfavorable jurisdiction, late payment penalties, broad IP assignment).
- Per-clause risk explanations in plain English, not just a score.
- Downloadable PDF risk report (generated server-side, served via a time-limited presigned S3 URL).
- Dashboard with aggregate stats (contracts reviewed, high-risk count, average risk score) and full contract history.
- Contract status tracking (`PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `PROCESSED`/`FAILED`) visible in real time on the detail page.

  IAM roles scope each service to only the permissions it needs.
  CloudWatch Logs capture stdout from both services.
  Secrets Manager holds the RDS master credentials (never in code or images).
```

**Workflow:**

1. User registers/logs in and uploads a contract PDF via the web service.
2. Web service stores the raw file in S3, creates a `PENDING` row in RDS, and publishes a job message to SQS.
3. The worker service (a separate ECS service, scaled independently) long-polls SQS, marks the contract `PROCESSING`, and calls Textract to extract text directly from the S3 object (async job, supports multi-page and scanned documents).
4. The worker runs the extracted text through the rule-based risk engine, which segments the text into clauses and matches each against 10 risk categories with severity weights.
5. The worker generates a PDF risk report, uploads it to S3, and writes all clause results plus the aggregate score to RDS in a single transaction, marking the contract `PROCESSED` (or `FAILED` with a message on error).
6. The user's dashboard and contract detail page reflect the final status, with the flagged clauses, explanations, and a report download link (presigned S3 URL).

## AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Amazon ECR** | Stores the `clauseguard-web` and `clauseguard-worker` container images (mandatory service). |
| **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** | Runs both services as independently scalable, serverless containers — no EC2 patching (mandatory service). |
| **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** | Stores users, contracts, clauses, and auth tokens (mandatory relational database). |
| **Amazon S3** | Stores raw contract uploads and generated PDF reports. |
| **Amazon SQS** | Decouples the web service from the worker; includes a dead-letter queue for failed jobs. |
| **Amazon Textract** | Extracts text from PDFs, including scanned/photographed documents. |
| **AWS IAM** | Least-privilege roles scoped separately for the execution role, the web task role, and the worker task role. |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Stores the RDS master password; never hardcoded or baked into images. |
| **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** | Captures logs from both ECS services via the `awslogs` driver. |
| **Elastic Load Balancing (ALB)** | Publicly exposes the web service and performs health checks against `/healthz`. |

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.12, Flask 3, gunicorn
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 templates, vanilla JavaScript, hand-written CSS (no framework)
- **Database:** Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16
- **Infrastructure automation:** Python + boto3
- **Containers:** Docker, Amazon ECS (Fargate), Amazon ECR
- **AWS SDK:** boto3

## Installation

See [instructions.md](./instructions.md) for the complete first-time setup walkthrough (AWS account setup, IAM, running locally, deploying). Quick summary:

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd clauseguard

# Local Postgres for development
docker compose up -d

# Web service
cd web
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in values
python wsgi.py

# Worker service (separate terminal)
cd worker
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in values
python -m worker.main
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables — see `web/.env.example` and `worker/.env.example`. No secrets are hardcoded anywhere in the codebase. In production, `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD` are injected into the ECS task via Secrets Manager (see `infrastructure/provision.py`), not plain environment variables.

## Deployment

```bash
pip install -r infrastructure/requirements.txt
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")

python3 infrastructure/provision.py     # creates all AWS resources (idempotent)
./infrastructure/deploy.sh              # builds, pushes images, deploys ECS services
```

Full step-by-step deployment guide: [instructions.md](./instructions.md).

To tear everything down and stop incurring charges:

```bash
python3 infrastructure/teardown.py
```

## Challenges Faced

- **Multi-page and scanned PDFs**: Textract's synchronous API only supports single-page documents, so the worker uses the asynchronous `start_document_text_detection` / `get_document_text_detection` job API with pagination, which required a polling loop with a bounded retry ceiling.
- **Async job visibility vs. correctness**: the SQS visibility timeout had to be set comfortably above the worst-case Textract processing time so a slow job isn't picked up twice by accident, while the dead-letter queue catches genuinely broken jobs after repeated failures.
- **S3 CORS configuration**: the boto3 method for setting bucket CORS rules is `put_bucket_cors`, not `put_bucket_cors_configuration` — a naming trap that's easy to get wrong and silently call an API that doesn't exist.
- **Two-service ECS design**: giving the worker its own task role, security group, and scaling story (rather than bundling it into the web container) took more upfront IAM/networking work but reflects how this would actually be built in production.

## Future Improvements

- Auto-scaling policies on the worker ECS service based on `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` in SQS.
- HTTPS via ACM + a custom domain on the ALB.
- Support for `.docx` contracts in addition to PDF.
- Per-organization accounts and team sharing of contract history.
- Replace polling-based Textract calls with an SNS completion notification to reduce worker idle polling.

## What I Learned

Building ClauseGuard reinforced how to design a genuine two-service containerized architecture on ECS Fargate — including the IAM, networking, and load-balancing plumbing that a single-container demo skips — and how to build a reliable async processing pipeline with SQS, including dead-letter handling and idempotent infrastructure-as-code with boto3.
